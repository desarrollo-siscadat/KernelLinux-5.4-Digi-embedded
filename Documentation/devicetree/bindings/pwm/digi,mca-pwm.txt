Digi ConnectCore SOMs Micro Controller Assist PWM

Required properties:
	- compatible: must be "digi,mca-pwm"
	- #address-cells: must be 1
	- #size-cells: must be 0

	  The child nodes of this node represent the PWM controllers, this
	  means, the pwmchips. If the nodes are not present no pwmchips will be
	  added to the system.

	  The properties of the PWM nodes are the following:

		Required properties:
			* reg: index of the MCA PWM controller.
			* pwm-channels: number of channels of the PWM
			  controller. Note that the frequency is common for all
			  the channels of the pwmchip. If different frequency
			  values are set on different channels the frequency of
			  all the channels will match the value of the last
			  channel set.
			* #pwm-cells: It must be three.See pwm.txt in this
			  directory for a description of the cells format.

Example:
	mca_cc8x: mca@63 {
		pwms {
			compatible = "digi,mca-pwm";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			mca_pwm0: pwm@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				pwm-channels = <6>;
				#pwm-cells = <3>;
			};

			mca_pwm1: pwm@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				pwm-channels = <2>;
				#pwm-cells = <3>;
			};

			mca_pwm2: pwm@2 {
				reg = <2>;
				pwm-channels = <2>;
				#pwm-cells = <3>;
			};
		};
	};
