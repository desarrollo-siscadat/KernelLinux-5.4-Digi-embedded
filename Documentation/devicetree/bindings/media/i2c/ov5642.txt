* Omnivision OV5642 CSI sensor

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "ov564x"
- clocks: reference to the xclk input clock.
- clock-names: should be "xclk".
- DOVDD-supply: Digital I/O voltage supply, 1.8 volts
- AVDD-supply: Analog voltage supply, 2.8 volts
- DVDD-supply: Digital core voltage supply, 1.5 volts
- csi_id: csi id for v4l2 capture device

Optional Properties:
- pwn-gpios: set according to the board.
- rst-gpios: set according to the board.
- digi,defer-probe: Voluntarily defer probe to give other camera sensors
  the chance to probe first and if using digi,alt-pwn-gpios place this one
  in power down so that they can reconfigure its i2c slave address (in case
  of i2c slave address clash)

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

&i2c1 {
	ov5642: ov5642@3c {
		compatible = "ov564x";
		reg = <0x3c>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_csi>;
		clocks = <&clks IMX6UL_CLK_CSI>;
		clock-names = "csi_mclk";
		csi_id = <0>;
		mclk = <24000000>;
		mclk_source = <0>;
		status = "disabled";
		digi,defer-probe;
		port {
			ov5642_ep: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&csi_ep>;
			};
		};
	};
};
